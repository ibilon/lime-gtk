# Lime Gtk+

*Work in progress.*

A proof of concept on running a lime application inside of a gtk+ window.

## Compiling the ndll

Run:
```bash
cd project
haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -DHXCPP_M64 -Dfulldebug
```

You need development libraries for:
* Gtk+ 2
* GtkGlExt
* Their dependencies

## Compiling the samples

You need a custom lime and openfl:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibilon/openfl.git -b lime
haxelib dev lime lime

git clone https://github.com/ibilon/openfl.git -b embed
haxelib dev openfl openfl
```

Then in each sample directory run:
```bash
lime build neko -Dnext -embed -debug
```

To revert to normal lime and openfl run:
```bash
haxelib dev lime
haxelib dev openfl
```

## Launching the application

```bash
haxe build.hxml
```
